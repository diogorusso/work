description: "Visual identity and promotional materials for the event tocayo 12. The event brought together more than 3000 people in a warehouse for a night of great art and music. Media cards, tickets, shirts, website, promotional teasers and contents for social media were developed. After two years occuring in a reduced format, the multimedia event returned to its original version bringing together dozens of artists from various backgrounds in the Ação da Cidadania warehouse on December 3, 2011. There were 12 hours of cultural activities geared towards all tastes and ages, including workshops, performances, cinema, exhibitions, concerts and Djs. This was the largest edition of tocayo, and its goal was to promote works of new and renowned artists in Rio de Janeiro."
