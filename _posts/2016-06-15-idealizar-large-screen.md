description: "In partnership with the agency Idealizar, we created multi-projections using 5 screens. Life Forum Event - National Confederation of General Insurance, Private Pension and Life, Supplementary Health and Capitalization in 2014. In 2015 we developed projects for insurance events in Iguazu Falls and for SulAm√©rica in Bahia. In the anthem video the challenge was to accompany the national anthem with images characteristic of the Brazilian culture. From the theme - what will be tomorrow? - we created a script to tell the story of the human evolution and the current paradox of aging."
